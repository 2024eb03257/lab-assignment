Linux File System Analysis Project

Project Overview:
This document serves as educational material for understanding Linux file system 
concepts, specifically focusing on hard links, symbolic links, and inode management.

Created: $(date)
Author: System Administration Training Program
Purpose: Educational demonstration for Linux systems engineering lab

Key Concepts to Demonstrate:
1. Hard Links - Multiple directory entries pointing to same inode
2. Symbolic Links - Path references to target files
3. Inodes - File system metadata structures
4. Link Counts - Tracking multiple references to same data
5. File Metadata - Comprehensive file information

Technical Specifications:
- File System Type: ext4
- Block Size: 4096 bytes
- Inode Size: 256 bytes
- Default Permissions: 0644 (rw-r--r--)

Experiment Parameters:
- Original File: sample_data.txt
- Hard Link: sample_hard.txt (shares same inode)
- Symbolic Link: sample_soft.txt (different inode, contains path)

Expected Observations:
1. sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt will share identical inode number
2. sample_soft.txt will have different inode number
3. Link count for original file will increase from 1 to 2 after hard link creation
4. Deleting symbolic link will not affect original file
5. File size remains consistent across hard links

Educational Value:
This exercise demonstrates fundamental file system concepts including:
- How Linux stores file metadata separately from data
- The difference between hard and symbolic links
- Inode usage and management
- File system efficiency through link sharing

Additional Notes:
- All operations are performed within user space
- No system configuration changes required
- Outputs will vary based on actual system environment
- This file serves as baseline for comparative analysis
